    Client Diffie-Hellman Public Value

        This structure conveys the client's Diffie-Hellman public value
        (Yc) if it was not already included in the client's certificate.

        The encoding used for Yc is determined by the enumerated
        PublicValueEncoding.  This structure is a variant of the client
        key exchange message, and not a message in itself.

    Structure of this message:

      enum { implicit, explicit } PublicValueEncoding;

      implicit
         If the client has sent a certificate which contains a suitable
         Diffie-Hellman key (for fixed_dh client authentication), then
         Yc is implicit and does not need to be sent again.  In this
         case, the client key exchange message will be sent, but it MUST
         be empty.

      explicit
         Yc needs to be sent.

      struct {
          select (PublicValueEncoding) {
              case implicit: struct { };
              case explicit: opaque dh_Yc<1..2^16-1>;
          } dh_public;
      } ClientDiffieHellmanPublic;

      dh_Yc
         The client's Diffie-Hellman public value (Yc).
